                <h1>Infecto</h1>
                <p>Infecto is a single player game, which was a group project done over 8 days with 6 people in the group. The game was made on the GXP engine with our own physics engine. The game’s intention is targeted at children and its purpose is to teach children in a fun way how basic human biology works. The game is a 2D puzzle game where the player needs to figure out a basic puzzle in order to advance.
<br><br>My contributions: I worked on the website for the game and did part of the coding for the video game. While also managing the different roles by being the team leader.

                <h1>Vivid</h1>
                <p>Vivid was a group project made over the span of 10 days with 6 people. The game was a 2D puzzle platformer where the player needed to solve a puzzle with redirecting lasers in order to advance to the next level. The game was developed on the GXP engine.<br><br>
My contributions: For this project I created the concept of the redirecting lasers and helped code the video game. I also coded the website for it.

                <h1>Four Heroes</h1>
                <p>Four Heroes was a two weeklong group project, where the goal was to develop a board game. Using tabletop simulator to create the game. The game was a Turn-based RPG 1 v 4 player experience. The game was made and optimised to be played with 2-5 players. 1 player always playing as the villain and the rest playing as the heroes.<br><br>
My contributions: For this project I came up with the entire combat system and general system of how it was a 1 player against others. This was a rather unique aspect to games. I was also the team leader for this project.

                <h1>Deal!</h1>
                <p>Deal was a project done with processing with only 4 people. It was a basic money-making game, where the player needed to make as much money from pawning people as possible.
<br><br>My contributions: For this project since there were little people, we had a lot of work. I made the website, designed the game as well as helped with the coding.
